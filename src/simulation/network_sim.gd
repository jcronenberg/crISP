## TODO
## When a house couldn't get a connection it still up to the point where the allocation failed allocated
## bandwidth until that cable. So e.g. if path is [5, 2, 0] and 5 is successful but 2 not then 5 would still
## get allocated 50. Not a trivial change because theoretically we would need to go back and change already
## allocated bandwidth. However I don't think this is a priority as the plan currently is to start a fail
## countdown when a house isn't connected anyway, so this enhancement would only really help in identifying
## issues in the network a bit better.
## (does this really ever matter? I think actually not because it still goes through all the houses one by one
## and tries to connect for every house, so they actually shouldn't cannibalize because if there is a path
## it will get allocated, so it should always connect as many houses as possible, because we go through the
## houses one by one. It should only matter if we somehow go through houses in parallel, but I don't think
## this will ever be necessary and I think we would run into many other race conditions anyway then)
##
## Maybe don't make this a node and instead control the simulation steps from the outside.
